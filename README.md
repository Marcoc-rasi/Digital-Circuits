# Digital-Circuits
In this repository I play with Proteus to build electronic circuits and simulate them, in turn I program various projects for the Tiva c model tm4c1294ncpdt development board from Texas Instruments, which works with ARM processors, programming in assembly language and in c.
The most complete project is "Motorcycle alarm" which contains a document that explains the resolution and code used.

There are README files that contain the operating information of each program, do not forget to check them
