#Display 7-segment
A 7-segment digital circuit is an electronic device used to visually represent numbers and some characters using seven LED diodes arranged in segments. Each segment is identified with a letter from A to G and can be turned on or off depending on the combination to be displayed. In addition, there is an eighth LED that represents a decimal point (DP).
7-segment digital circuits can be common anode or common cathode, depending on whether the LEDs are connected by their positive or negative terminal, respectively. This means that to turn on a segment, a positive or negative voltage must be applied to its corresponding terminal, depending on the type of circuit.
The video shows the operation of a common anode 7-segment digital circuit controlled by a BCD to 7-segment decoder that converts a 4-bit binary input into the appropriate output for the display. The decoder is connected to a power source and a switch that allows changing the binary input value.
By changing the binary input value, the decoder activates the corresponding segments of the display to show the equivalent decimal number. For example, if the input is 0000, the display shows the number 0; if the input is 0001, the display shows number 1; and so on up to number 9. If the input is greater than 9, the display does not show any valid number.
The 7-segment digital circuit is a very useful component for displaying numerical information in electronic devices such as clocks, calculators, counters, etc. Its advantage is its simplicity and effectiveness when using it.
