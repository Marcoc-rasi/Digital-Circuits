The file contains the documentation of a digital circuit project made by the user Marcoc-rasi. The project consists of designing and implementing a motorcycle alarm using the Tiva C TM4C1294NCPDT development board from Texas Instruments, which has an ARM Cortex-M4 processor. The alarm is activated by a movement sensor and emits a sound and a light signal. The file explains the goals, requirements, design, code, testing, and results of the project, as well as conclusions and recommendations. The file is 16 pages long and includes images, diagrams, tables, and source code.

# BikeAlarm

In this article we are going to describe the code found inside the "AlarmMoto1" folder
The objective of the code is to implement an alarm for a motorcycle that is activated when a movement or vibration is detected in the vehicle. The alarm consists of a sound generated by a buzzer and a flashing LED. In addition, the code allows you to deactivate the alarm by means of a button or by means of an infrared remote control.
The code is divided into several files: main.c, alarm.h, alarm.c, infrared.h, and infrared.c. Next we will briefly explain the content and function of each one of them.
- main.c: It is the main file of the program, where the peripherals are initialized and the functions of the other files are called. An interrupt is also defined by the A0 timer that is used to generate the buzzer sound and the LED flashing.
- alarm.h: It is the header file where the constants, global variables and functions related to the alarm are declared. Among the constants are the pins where the buzzer, the LED, the button and the motion sensor are connected. Among the global variables are the flags that indicate the state of the alarm and the deactivation mode. The functions include those that configure the pins as inputs or outputs, those that activate or deactivate the alarm, and those that check if there is movement or if the button has been pressed.
- alarm.c: It is the file where the functions declared in alarm.h are defined. Here the alarm logic is implemented, such as how to generate the buzzer sound by a PWM, how to make the LED blink by a counter, how to read the motion sensor value by an ADC and how to disable it. the alarm with a password.
- infrared.h: It is the header file where the constants, global variables and functions related to the infrared remote control are declared. Among the constants are the hexadecimal codes that correspond to the buttons on the controller. Among the global variables are those that store the data received by the infrared receiver. Functions include those that configure the UART serial port to communicate with the infrared receiver and those that decode the received data.
- infrared.c: It is the file where the functions declared in infrared.h are defined. Infrared communication is implemented here, such as how to initialize the UART with the proper parameters, how to read a byte from the infrared receiver using a receive interrupt, and how to interpret the received byte according to the NEC protocol.

With this code we can have an alarm for our motorcycle that notifies us if someone tries to move or steal it. In addition, we can control the alarm from afar with an infrared remote control.
