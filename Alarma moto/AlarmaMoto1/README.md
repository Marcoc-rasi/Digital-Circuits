# Alarma Motocicleta

This code is designed to run on a Tiva C model TM4C1294NCPDT board and controls various electronic devices, including an LCD display, matrix keyboard, servo motor, and LED lights. The code also reads values from various analog sensors connected to pins E0 through E3.
The code starts by including various libraries and defining global variables and constants. It then defines various functions to initialize and control the electronic devices connected to the board.
The `configuracionPuertos` function enables ports K, M and B and configures them as digital outputs. The `Cronometro` function uses the SysTick timer to generate a specified delay in seconds. The `clearPorts` function clears data on ports K and M.
The `inicioDisplay` function initializes the LCD display and sends various commands to configure it. The `EscribirDatos` function writes data to the display using ports M and K. The `Abecedario` function takes a character as an input parameter and uses a `switch` declaration to write the character to the display using the `EscribirDatos` function .
The `inicioLucesYMov` function enables port P0 and configures pins P0 and P1 as digital input and output, respectively. The `inicioServo` function enables port D and sets timer 0 for use with pin D0. The `inicioServo` function also sets timer 0 to generate a PWM signal with a frequency of 50 Hz and a variable duty cycle. The `girarServoIzquierda` and `girarServoDerecha` functions use timer 0 to generate a PWM signal that turns a servo left or right, respectively.
The `inicioDispositivosAnalogicos` function enables port E and configures pins E0 to E5 as analog inputs. It also configures the ADC module to perform analog conversions on pins E0 to E3 using sample sequencers 0 to 3. The `LeerPuertosAnalogicos` function reads the values of analog pins E0 to E3 and stores them in the global variables `Fotoresistencia`, `lm35`, `AcelerometroX` and `AcelerometroY`. The `PromediarValoresAnalogicos` function reads the values of analog pins E2 and E3 ten times and calculates the average of the values read.
The functions `prenderLuces` and `apagarLuces` turn the lights connected to pin P0 on and off, respectively. The `vigilarMovimiento` function checks the state of the P1 pin and, if enabled, turns the lights on and off using the `prenderLuces` and `apagarLuces` functions.
The ``TecladoIni`` function enables the H and Q ports and configures them as digital inputs and outputs, respectively. The `CaracterisarTeclado` function reads the state of the keyboard connected to ports H and Q using the `LeerPosicionColumna` function. The `LeerPosicionColumna` function takes an input parameter specifying the keyboard column being read and uses a `switch` statement to read the value from port H and check the code entered using the `VerificarCodigo` function. The `VerificarCodigo` function takes a character as an input parameter and checks if it matches a predefined code. If the code is correct, write "Open" on the display and turn a servo left and then right using the `girarServoIzquierda` and `girarServoDerecha` functions. If the code is wrong, write "Wrong" on the display.
Finally, the `main` function initializes various devices by calling the corresponding startup functions. It then goes into an infinite loop where inside the loop, it checks the status of port B and calls the `alarma` or `AbrirCajuela` functions depending on the value read. The `alarma` function writes "Protected" to the display, calls the `vigilarMovimiento` function and checks the value of analog pin E2, the motion sensor. If the value is outside a specified range, turn the lights on and off using the `prenderLuces` and `apagarLuces` functions. The `AbrirCajuela` function writes "Code" on the display and calls the `CaracterisarTeclado` function to read the code entered by the user using the matrix keyboard.
