# Circuito restador y flip flop
 
 - Subtractor circuit: 
 
 it is a file with the extension .pdsprj that contains the design of a two-bit subtractor circuit using logic gates. The subtractor circuit is capable of performing the binary operation A - B, where A and B are two-bit numbers, and obtaining the result R and the carry C. The circuit uses four XOR gates to obtain the bits of R and two AND gates. and an OR to get the bit of C. The circuit has four inputs (A1, A0, B1, B0) and three outputs (R1, R0, C).
- Flip flop: it is a file with the extension .pdsprj that contains the design of a JK flip flop with asynchronous preset and clear inputs. A JK flip flop is a memory device that has two inputs (J and K) and two outputs (Q and Q'). The flip flop changes state according to signals applied to its inputs and to a clock (CLK) input. The flip flop has four modes of operation: hold (if J = K = 0), change (if J = K = 1), set to 1 (if J = 1 and K = 0), and set to 0 (if J = 0). 0 and K = 1). The flip flop also has two asynchronous inputs that allow the device state to be initialized regardless of the other inputs: preset (PRE) sets Q to 1 and clear (CLR) sets Q to 0. These inputs are turned low. The circuit uses four NAND gates to implement the function of the JK flip flop.

# HEX 7 SEG y TEMP555

Your files are:
- HEX 7 SEG and TEMP555.DSN: It is the file that contains the design of the circuit in the Proteus program. The circuit consists of a hexadecimal counter that shows the values from 0 to F on a seven-segment display (display). The display is an electronic component that is made up of seven LEDs (segments) that can be turned on or off individually to represent characters. Each segment is identified with a letter from A to G. The counter uses a 74LS90 integrated circuit that generates the necessary pulses to increase the value shown on the display. The counter is connected to a 74LS47 decoder that converts the binary value of the counter into the corresponding code to activate the display segments. The display is of the common cathode type, which means that all the cathodes of the LEDs are connected to a common pin that must go to ground (level 0). To turn on each segment a high level (level 1) must be applied to the corresponding pin through a current limiting resistor. The circuit also includes a 555 timer that generates a square signal with a frequency adjustable via a potentiometer. This signal is used to control the speed of the counter. The 555 timer is a very versatile integrated circuit that can function as an oscillator, monostable, or astable depending on how its terminals are connected.

The basic operation of a transistor consists of modifying an electrical output signal in response to an electrical input signal, acting as an amplifier, switch, oscillator, or rectifier. A transistor is made up of three elements: base, collector, and emitter. Transistors can be classified according to the type of semiconductor material they use (germanium, silicon, gallium arsenide, etc.) and according to the type of current that flows between their terminals (direct current or alternating current).
